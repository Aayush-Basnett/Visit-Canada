        description: 'Canada’s north is home to some of Canada’s most unusual wildlife, and the Yukon Wildlife Preserve works to keep it that way. Located only 25 minutes from downtown Whitehorse, the Preserve’s enthusiastic staff care for injured wild animals before releasing the healthy ones back into the wild. Visitors can tour the preserve to learn about more than a dozen different species of Arctic and boreal animals. Tour the facility’s three-mile ‘viewing loop’ on foot, by ski, by snowshoe, or on a guided bus. See caribou, lynx, elk, bison, and more in their distinct natural habitats, from wetlands to cliffs, but not in a pen or a cage. And be camera ready—you never know what animals are going to make an appearance.',

        description: 'Miles Canyon was once a daunting site for gold seekers. Many tried and failed to cross the canyon, or navigate their supply-filled boats through the rushing whitewater of the Yukon River. While a rail system allowed these prospectors to skirt this hazard, today the Miles Canyon isn’t a place you want to avoid. Visitors are treated to a slightly calmer river nowadays, thanks to a hydroelectric dam which slowed the flow of water. A suspension bridge was built in 1922 to connect the two 50-foot sides of the canyon, where it still sits today, making for an incredible view of the canyon if you’re not afraid of heights. This site, only minutes from downtown Whitehorse, also provides great hiking, mountain biking, and cross-country skiing trails, as well as opportunities to see a variety of wildlife.',

Ontario’s very first provincial park is overflowing with activities for every ability and preference. In the warmer seasons, you’ve got backcountry camping, hiking, biking, boating, fishing, picnicking, swimming, whitewater canoeing, and wildlife watching (say that five times fast!). In the winter, you can add on cross country skiing, snowmobiling, and dog sledding. There are over 1,500 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers located within the park, and you’ll find over 1,200 campsites dotted along their shores. In other words, there’s no shortage of reasons to visit.",

Canada’s recession in 2014/2015 did at least make Canadian dollars cheaper, making this a good time to visit for US and European travellers. In remote areas such as Labrador and the far north, everything starts to get significantly more expensive – travel here is much harder on a budget. Accommodation, almost certainly your major outlay, can be very pricey in any of the country’s cities and towns – especially if you’re after a degree of comfort – but there are plenty of bargains to be had, not least in the burgeoning hostel and B&B market.",

        description: "As of March 2016, Canada requires all visa-exempt foreign nationals who fly to Canada to get Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) in advance. This applies to citizens of the EU, Norway, Iceland and most Commonwealth countries, including the UK, Australia and New Zealand – passport holders from South Africa must still apply for formal visas in advance. You must apply for eTA online and pay a $7 fee – most are approved within minutes and are valid for five years (multiple entry). You’ll need a valid passport, an email address and a credit card (not debit card) to complete the online form. Visit wcic.gc.ca for the latest requirements and forms. US citizens only need a passport or approved alternative to enter Canada (and can stay for up to six months without a visa). Note that eTA is also not required for anyone visiting Canada by land and sea from the US – border formalities at these entry points remain unchanged. At the border itself the immigration officer decides the length of stay permitted – usually not more than six months. The officers rarely refuse entry, but they may delve deep, asking you for details of your schedule and enquiring as to how much money you have and what job you do; they may also ask to see a return or onward ticket.For visits of more than six months, study trips and stints of (temporary) employment, contact the nearest Canadian embassy, consulate or high commission for authorization prior to departure. Once inside Canada, if you need an extension of your stay or want to change the basis on which you were admitted, you must apply to the nearest Canada Immigration Centre at least thirty days before the expiry of the authorized visit. Most visitors to Canada cannot work or study in the country without a special permit. For duty-free, the standard allowance is 1.5 litres of wine or 1.14 litres of liquor or 24 355ml bottles/cans of beer, plus two hundred cigarettes, fifty cigars or cigarillos, and 200g of tobacco.",

Wheelchair users may encounter problems when travelling on urban public transport, but this is changing rapidly. Out in the wilds, things are inevitably more problematic, but almost all the national parks have accessible visitor and information centres and many have specially designed, accessible trails. In addition, VIA Rail offers a good range of services for travellers with disabilities – and the larger car-rental companies can provide vehicles with hand controls at no extra charge, though these are usually only available on their most expensive models; book one as far in advance as you can. Provincial tourist offices are the prime source of information on accessible hotels, motels and sights. To obtain a parking privilege permit, drivers with disabilities must apply to a provincial authority, though the permit itself, once issued, is valid across Canada. Useful websites include wotc-cta.gc.ca/eng/take-charge.        ",
